My very first concrete project in HTML/CSS. Though it is a simple page, it was challenging as I tried to rely on tutorials only when I was really stuck.


### Continued development

I'd like to finish this challenge with responsive design.
I want to do more challenges to be more comfortable with HTML/CSS.
